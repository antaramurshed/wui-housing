# Project Proposal

## Introduction 
For this group project, we will be exploring what relationships exist between wildfires and housing in California. Our research question now asks: How has structure destruction from wildfires affected different groups of people? Socio-economically, who are the people most impacted by living in wildfire incident prone areas.
 
We use the WUI**(Wildland Urban Interface) map of California as a reference to understand where increased risk of wildfire structural damage may be but will not be using for further spatial analysis as WUI data is too large for JupyterHub. The WUI is expected to increase in size and impact more and more people. Wildfires in California (and around the world) are increasing in intensity, duration, and frequency while housing insecurity continues to be one of our society’s largest failures. We hope to examine structure damage, wildfire intensity, and demographic data relating to housing (this includes homeowner tenure, income, and race). 

**The U.S. Fire Administration defines WUI as “the zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. It is the line, area or zone where structures and other human development meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland or vegetative fuels.”

## Spatial Scope 
We have chosen to focus on California, the state with the highest number of homes in the WUI. So far we have been analyzing at the county level because census data has made that information readily available. However, we may want to make our scope smaller, and possibly focus on the project by specific wildfire (for example, the Camp Fire had destroyed the most structures in a single wildfire on record, over 18,000). Examining the few counties that the Camp Fire encompassed may allow us to have more detailed analysis of housing/structure/socioeconomic data. 

## Data Sources 
Two of the data sources we’ll be using are: 

This data provides the instances of wildfire across the state from 2013-2020: https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/california-wildfire-incidents-20132020 

Census report data of homeowner tenure (renter versus owner occupied housing) in California by County from the year 2019: https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B25003&geo_ids=140|31000US41940&primary_geo_id=31000US41940#

We want to understand which demographics have been the most impacted by and live or lived in proximty to structure destruction in wildfires between 2013-2020. 

## Methodology
In order to answer this question we have been conducting data exploration of wildfire incident data, but have only found point data sources so far. This may mean we have to create centroid or distance analyses of incident points as the center and comparing the point's proximity to other demographic data. We would also like to do an additional analysis of demographics, housing availability, housing quality and rebuilding efforts. 

## Possible Research Insights
Increasing wildfires and an expanding WUI show us how the urban/rural divide is disappearing over time and forces us to think about urbanization in a different way. Wildland fires have increasingly destroyed man-made structures in the last 10 years and the socio-political realities of losing one's home or town are becoming more difficult to ignore. As the climate crisis intensifies, so do social inequalities related to housing. As human development and wildfire prone areas become more intermingled, where and how future housing is built will be increasingly impacted by biophysical events. We hope to understand how wildfire risk, housing status, and demographics intersect with each other.
