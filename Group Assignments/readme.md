# Project Proposal

## Introduction 
For this group project, we will be exploring the relationship between wildfires and housing in California. Our research question asks: How has proximity to the wildland urban interface (WUI)** affected housing security and displacement in California? 
 
As the ongoing climate crisis worsens, the WUI is expected to increase in size and impact more and more people. Wildfires in California (and around the world) are increasing in intensity, duration, and frequency while housing insecurity continues to be one of our society’s largest failures. We hope to examine how the WUI has changed over time, how that change has affected who is able to continue to live in these wildfire prone areas and who has been displaced. 

**The U.S. Fire Administration defines WUI as “the zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. It is the line, area or zone where structures and other human development meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland or vegetative fuels.”

## Spatial Scope 
We have chosen to focus on California, the state with the highest number of homes in the WUI. We have access to WUI data between 1990-2010, allowing us to compare changes in WUI over time. However, some of the largest wildfires on record have happened in the last ten years, and we hope to find more recent data on WUIs in California to compare to more recent wildfire occurrences. 

## Data Sources 
Three of the data sources we’ll be using are: 

This includes data that shows the number of homes in the WUI relative to the number homes in the state: https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2015-0012-2 

This data shows changes in WUI from 1990-2010: http://silvis.forest.wisc.edu/data/wui-change/  

This data provides the instances of wildfire across the state from 2013-2020: https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/california-wildfire-incidents-20132020 

We intend to include housing and demographic data to understand where there is the greatest impact and overlap between wildfire urban interface patterns and housing, especially as it relates to housing stock and housing quality. We may also look into the demographics of unhoused persons and their available resources but haven’t made a definitive decision. 

## Methodology
In order to answer this question, we first plan on differentiating between wildland interface and wildland intermix, which are the two main gradations in WUI. From there we want to explore the impact of WUI on one region and how many wildfires have occurred in the area; we have not yet chosen a region. We would also like to do an additional analysis of demographics, housing availability, housing quality and rebuilding efforts. 

## Possible Research Insights
Increasing wildfires and an expanding WUI show us how the urban/rural divide is disappearing over time and forces us to think about urbanization in a different way. As the climate crisis intensifies, so do social inequalities related to housing. As human development and wildfire prone areas become more intermingled, where and how future housing is built will be increasingly impacted by biophysical events. We hope to understand how wildfire risk, housing status, and demographics intersect with each other.
